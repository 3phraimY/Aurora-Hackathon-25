**Key Objectives:**

- **RSS Feed Integration:**  
  Build a feature that aggregates and displays content from one or more RSS feeds.

- **Role-Based Access:**  
  Implement a system to group users by roles, allowing for tailored access to specific types of feeds.

- **Notification Functionality:**  
  Develop a dynamic notification system to alert users of new content and important updates.

Additional details and guidelines will be provided on the day of the Hackathon.
